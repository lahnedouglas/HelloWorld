The beginning of my endeavors in coding.

Here, I will be recording any and all lines of written code and other materials pertinent to my quest to seek knowledge in the technology sector.  All works contained, therein, are of my own creation and will be claimed as such.  
My first course of study will be from the Harvard CS50X Introdution to Computer Science.
